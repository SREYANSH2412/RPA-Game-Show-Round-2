The RPA (Robotic Process Automation) Club has a large and growing membership base, and they need a streamlined and efficient way to generate certificates for their members who complete various courses, workshops, and events. The current manual process of creating certificates is time-consuming and prone to errors, which creates frustration for both the club and its members. The RPA Club needs an automated certificate generator tool that can quickly and accurately generate customized certificates for each member. The tool should be user-friendly and flexible, allowing the club to easily update the certificate templates and include personalized information for each member. How can we create an automated certificate generator that meets the needs of the RPA Club and its members and helps to streamline the certificate generation process?
