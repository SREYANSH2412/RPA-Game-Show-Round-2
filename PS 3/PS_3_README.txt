The Magic Kingdom Company (Disney) needs to communicate important updates and promotions to its large cast of characters, including Mickey Mouse, Cinderella, and Buzz Lightyear, through email. However, the current process of sending emails in bulk is a hassle and often leads to emails being marked as spam or not being delivered at all. The company needs an automated email transfer tool that can send bulk emails quickly and efficiently while ensuring high deliverability rates and avoiding spam filters. The tool should be as user-friendly as a Disney ride and customizable as a Mickey Mouse hat, allowing the company to personalize each email and track its delivery and open rates. How can we create an automated bulk email transfer tool that meets the needs of The Magic Kingdom Company (Disney) and helps them communicate effectively with their cast of characters?
